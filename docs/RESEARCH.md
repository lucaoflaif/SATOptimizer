# Research Notes: Earth Observation Satellite Task Scheduler  

This document contains the extended technical and academic details behind the demo prototype.  

---

## Problem Statement  

Earth observation satellites face numerous scheduling challenges:  
- **Limited observation windows** due to orbital mechanics and target visibility  
- **Competing mission priorities** across multiple stakeholders  
- **Resource constraints** including power, data storage, and communication windows  
- **Dynamic environmental conditions** affecting image quality and mission success  
- **Complex interdependencies** between tasks and operational requirements  

Traditional scheduling approaches often struggle with the combinatorial complexity and multi-objective nature of satellite mission planning.

## Genetic Algorithm Approach  

### Why Genetic Algorithms?  

Genetic algorithms are particularly well-suited for satellite scheduling because they:  
- Handle **multi-objective optimization** naturally  
- Explore large solution spaces efficiently  
- Adapt to **dynamic constraints** and changing priorities  
- Provide **near-optimal solutions** in reasonable computational time  
- Scale well with problem complexity  

### Algorithm Architecture  

```
Main Tasks → Discretization → Population → Selection → Crossover → Mutation → Evaluation → Next Generation
    ↓             ↓               ↑                                                              ↓
Task Def.   Candidate Tasks       └─────────────── Convergence Check ←───────────────────────────┘
```  

Key components:  
- **Task Discretization**: Conversion of high-level mission tasks into discretized candidate tasks for GA optimization  
- **Chromosome Encoding**: Task sequences with timing and resource allocation  
- **Fitness Function**: Multi-objective evaluation considering mission success, resource utilization, and constraints  
- **Selection Strategy**: Tournament selection with elitism  
- **Operators**: Custom crossover/mutation for scheduling constraints  
- **Constraint Handling**: Penalty functions + repair mechanisms
